# Product Guidelines: FlowTask

## 1. Tone and Voice
- **Tech-Forward & Professional:** Use clear, precise language that reflects cutting-edge technology without being overly jargon-heavy.
- **Direct & Action-Oriented:** Focus on the "flow" of tasks. Instructions and feedback should be concise and drive the user toward completion.
- **Collaborative Assistant:** The AI should sound like a helpful peer—knowledgeable, efficient, and slightly encouraging.

## 2. Branding and Visual Identity
- **Modern Minimal:** A clean interface that prioritizes content and interactive elements over heavy decorative graphics.
- **High-Contrast Accents:** Use bold accent colors (compatible with Material You) to highlight key actions and AI interactions.
- **Motion-Driven:** Utilize Compose animations to provide tactile feedback and indicate "life" within the conversational UI.

## 3. User Experience (UX)
- **Fluid Navigation:** Minimize nested menus. Use conversational flows to jump directly to specific task actions.
- **Immediate Response:** Ensure UI transitions and AI responses feel instantaneous to support the "Flow" state.
- **Accessibility by Design:**
    - High contrast for readability.
    - Full screen-reader support (TalkBack).
    - Large touch targets for core task interactions.

## 4. Documentation Style
- **Code-First:** When documenting technical details, prioritize clear code snippets and architectural diagrams.
- **Consistent Terminology:** Always refer to the AI interface as the "Conversational Flow."
- **Focus on 'Why':** Explain the rationale behind UX decisions to maintain a coherent vision across the development team.
