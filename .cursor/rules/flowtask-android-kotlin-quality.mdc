# FlowTask Android Kotlin Quality

- Prefer explicit error paths over broad catch-all handlers that hide failures.
- Keep parsing code observable: return typed failures or log actionable diagnostics.
- Write or update unit tests for behavior changes in prompting and parsing logic.
- Avoid inline imports; keep imports at the top of files.
- Use exhaustive `when` handling for enums and sealed types.
- Keep UI and domain logic separated; avoid embedding business logic in `MainActivity`.
