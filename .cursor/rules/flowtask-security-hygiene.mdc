# FlowTask Security Hygiene

- Never commit debug logs such as `firebase-debug.log` or credential-adjacent artifacts.
- Treat AI inputs/outputs as untrusted; validate and sanitize before use.
- For parser/template changes, preserve strict handling for malformed responses.
- Revisit Android backup settings when adding user data persistence; avoid permissive defaults.
- Do not hardcode secrets, tokens, or API keys in source or tests.
- Call out security-impacting changes explicitly in review summaries.
