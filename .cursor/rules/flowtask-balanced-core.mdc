# FlowTask Balanced Core

- Keep changes scoped and reversible; avoid broad refactors unless requested.
- Before claiming success, run relevant verification commands and report results.
- Prefer fixing root causes over suppressing warnings or errors.
- If a command can be slow, run with a longer wait strategy or monitor in background until completion.
- Keep commit hygiene clean: do not commit logs, secrets, or environment-specific local files.
- Surface assumptions early when requirements are ambiguous.
