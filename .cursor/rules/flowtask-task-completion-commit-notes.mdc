# FlowTask Task Completion Protocol

- This protocol is strictly recommended whenever a task is finished.
- Before marking a task done, verify with relevant commands and report outcomes.
- Commit only task-relevant files; exclude local IDE/device artifacts and logs.
- After each task commit, attach a git note summarizing:
  - task name
  - why the change was made
  - files changed
  - verification commands and results
- If the conductor plan is updated for task/phase status, create a separate plan-status commit.
- When uncertain whether a file belongs in the task commit, ask before committing.
